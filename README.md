# Titanic_Analysis

# Project Aimed:
A little over 60% of the passengers in first class survived. Less than 30% of passengers in third class survived. That means less than half of the passengers in third class survived, compared to the passengers in first class. So the aim of the project is to predict that who surrived from the titanic accident based on some of the features like class,gender,age etc.

# Pre-Requisites:
Basic about Python3
Some of the Python Libraries
1.  numpy           "https://numpy.org/"
2.  pandas          "https://pypi.org/project/pandas/"
3.  seaborn         "https://pypi.org/project/seaborn/"
4.  sklearn         "https://pypi.org/project/sklearn/"
5.  matplotlib      "https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/"

# Installation:
There are some steps for installation
1.  Install Python3.            "https://www.python.org/downloads/"
2.  Install Jupyter Notebook.   "jupyter.org/install"
3.  Install all the libraries above mentioned by using "pip install library_name".
4.  Download the project. Run it in your system.

# Dataset:
In the given dataset there are following columns such as gender, age, name, etc. In the dataset, those who survived are mentioned with a label "!" and those who are not with"0".

Note: The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle: "https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic".

# Algorithm:
As the data is structured and after analyzing the dataset I came to know that we can use classifier in this project. So the classifier used in this is Logistic Regression. In this seaborn library that uses matplotlib is used to plot graphs and pandas is used for reading the dataset. 
I am getting 80% accuracy in this project through Logistic Regression.
